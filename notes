I was thinking of sampling this layout and put a few of my tweak to it. Here is the structure of the pages 

UI section -> this is the layout for the UI(User Interface)
Home -> descriptive; very simple not overfilled with info because less is more. 

About Us (dropdown list) -> the about will provide descriptive info about ESCC.
Our Staff (dropdown list) -> This page will feature the the staffs 
Mission (dropdown list) -> this page will illustrate the projects that ESCC is working on, future projects... 

Ministries (Section)
Women's Ministry (dropdown list) -> illustrate the women's ministry and perhaps their goals.
Children's ministry (dropdown list) -> illustrate the children'd minidtry and their goals.
Other ministries (dropdown list) -> TBD???
* in addition i was thinking of a verse referencing the ministry to add to ther page.

Media -> this will provide a list of all the previous services 
Media single -> when a visitor clicks on a specific service from the media page; They will be able to watch that spefic service. This is a strategy to push our facebook traffic to the site. 

Blog -> I will add a blog section because it will help imporving the SEO (Search Engine Optimization) 

Gallery -> this will be a page to post some pictures related to the church; churched organized events/activities 

Events -> this will be showing all of the opcoming events

Contact Us -> this will include a contact form; users can fill out to reach out to ESCC. In addition, social media links.

Donate -> this will be a button that will be linked to tithly setup

ADMIN PORTAL 
Admin -> admin will be used to administrate the site. this section will not be accessible to the public. Users will need to gain access to the backend portal. 

* user cannot be registered. someone has to register the user from inside the admin portal. I design it that way because only people who needs access gain access. 
In addition, this will be used to manage the the blog section, event section, sermon section, and gallery section.
